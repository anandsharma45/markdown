# Content Management API

<!-- Slide 2 -->
### What is CMA

- The Content Management API (CMA) is a write-access API that allows you to manage content, assets, and content types programmatically in Contentful.
- The CMA is primarily used for creating, updating, and deleting content, automating workflows, and managing spaces.

---

<!-- Slide 3 -->
### How CMA Works

- **RESTful API:**
    - The CMA uses REST architecture with standard HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with the Contentful platform.
- **Authentication:**
    - Requests to the CMA require management tokens for authentication and write access to content.
- **Endpoint Structure:**
    - https://api.contentful.com/spaces/{space_id}/{resource}

---

<!-- Slide 4 -->
### Authenticating with CMA

- **API Tokens:**
    - CMA requires an OAuth token with write access to interact with Contentful.

- **How to Generate:**
    - Go to Settings > API Keys in your Contentful space.
    - Create an API Key, ensuring the management access token is generated.

### Creating Content Types using CMA

- Use the POST method to create content types:
    - POST https://api.contentful.com/spaces/{space_id}/content_types
- Example Request:
> {
  "name": "Blog Post",
  "fields": [
    {
      "id": "title",
      "name": "Title",
      "type": "Text"
    }
  ]
}
- Publishing the Content Type after creation:
    - PUT https://api.contentful.com/spaces/{space_id}/content_types/{id}/published

---

<!-- Slide 6 -->
### Creating and Managing Entries with CMA

- Creating an Entry:
    - POST https://api.contentful.com/spaces/{space_id}/entries?content_type={content_type_id}
- Example:
> {
  "fields": {
    "title": {
      "en-US": "My First Blog Post"
    },
    "body": {
      "en-US": "Contentful is great!"
    }
  }
}
- Updating and Deleting Entries:
    - PUT https://api.contentful.com/spaces/{space_id}/entries/{entry_id}
    - DELETE https://api.contentful.com/spaces/{space_id}/entries/{entry_id}

---

<!-- Slide 7 -->
### Asset Management with CMA

- **Upload Asset:**
    - POST https://api.contentful.com/spaces/{space_id}/assets
- **Process the Asset:**
    - PUT https://api.contentful.com/spaces/{space_id}/assets/{asset_id}/files/{locale}/process
- **Publish Asset:**
    - PUT https://api.contentful.com/spaces/{space_id}/assets/{asset_id}/published

---

<!-- Slide 8 -->
### Managing Locales and Localization

- **Add a Locale:**
    - POST https://api.contentful.com/spaces/{space_id}/locales
- **Localizing Content:**
>{
  "fields": {
    "title": {
      "en-US": "Hello World",
      "fr-FR": "Bonjour le monde"
    }
  }
}

---

<!-- Slide 9 -->
### Considerations

- **API Rate Limits:**
    - Default rate limit for the CMA is 7 requests/second. Batch updates should be preferred.
- **Versioning:**
    - Contentful uses versioning to prevent overwriting content. Include the sys.version field when updating content.
- **Security:**
    - Use different tokens for different environments and keep management tokens secure.
