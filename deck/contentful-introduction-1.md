### What is Contentful

- Contentful is a cloud-based ***Headless CMS***.
- It separates content management from the front-end, allowing developers and content creators to work independently.
- Content is delivered through APIs, enabling flexibility to display content across multiple platforms (web, mobile, IoT, etc.).
- Offers API-first architecture, supporting REST and GraphQL for fetching and managing content programmatically.

### Why Headless CMS

- Traditional CMS: Tightly couples content with presentation.
- Headless CMS: Content managed independently, delivered via APIs.
- Allows flexible front-end development with any framework (React, Vue, etc.).
- Supports multi-channel delivery from a single content source.
