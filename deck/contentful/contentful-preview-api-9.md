### Limitations of the Preview API

- **Performance:**
    - The Preview API may be slightly slower than the Delivery API due to additional processing for unpublished content.
- **No Access to Deleted Entries:**
    - Entries that have been deleted from Contentful will not appear in the Preview API.
- **Rate Limits:**
    - The Preview API has rate limits that may affect how frequently content can be fetched. Default is 14 requests/second.
